You can contribute in a multitude of ways:

* **Code** - You can :doc:`contribute code <contrib/code>` to the LIMA mudlib. We use GitHub projects 
  to manage the development of the mudlib at `GitHub projects <https://github.com/orgs/limalib/projects/1>`_.
* **Documentation** - You can contribute to the documentation. The documentation is 
  written in reStructuredText and in the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ format 
  and is available at https://docs.limamudlib.dev/. It is partly generated from the mudlib code.
* **Bug Reports** - You can report bugs in the mudlib or the documentation, they can be
  reported at `LIMA GitHub issues <https://github.com/limalib/lima/issues>`_ for the mudlib and
  at `Docs GitHub issues <https://github.com/limalib/docs/issues>`_ for the documentation.
