LIMA Mudlib Documentation
*************************

**LIMA** (ˈlaɪmə) is a FluffOS based Mudlib originally developed in the 1990's.

For features of the LIMA Mudlib, please see our `showcase <Showcase.html>`_ which has lots of examples
of the features supported.

Check out the `usage <Usage.html>`_ page for further information, including
how to `install <Installation.html>`_ the project. A small helper on `messaging <documentation/Messaging.html>`_ 
and `how to use the AUTODOC system <documentation/Autodocs.html>`_ inside the mudlib is also available.
`Skills in LIMA <documentation/Skills_LIMA.html>`_ describes the skill system, and how to 
configure it for your purpose.

Learning paths
==============
We provide several learning paths here with exercises to facilitate better leaning:

   new to programming, LPC and MUDs.

   small quest.
