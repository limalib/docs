Player Command
==============

USAGE::

	wizcall <message>

 The wizcall command will let you send a message to all logged-in
 wizards.  This command is to be used ONLY for reporting dead-end
 traps, or other bugs that require immediate wizard assistance. Bugs
 not requiring the immediate attention of a wizard should be reported
 via "bug" instead. The excessive use of this command is grounds for
 removal of your character.
