Player Command
==============

$$ see : verbose
USAGE::

	brief
	brief on/off

Shows or sets whether you are using "brief" mode,
which ignores the room descriptions.
Use "brief" mode at your own risk - it greatly increases the chance
of missing important clues in the room descriptions,
and of upsetting creators whose masterpieces of text you are now ignoring.
