Player Command
==============

USAGE

 |  ``mudlist``
 |  ``mudlist <pattern>``

This command gives a full list of all muds and their addresses that
this mud knows about.  If you supply a pattern, the command only tells
you what muds match the pattern.

Examples:

  |  ``mudlist``	   - get all muds
  |  ``mudlist -a``	- get all muds, including those that are not up
  |  ``mudlist mud``	- get all muds that contain "mud" somewhere
	  |	                 in their name
  |  ``mudlist ^foo``	-- get all muds whose name starts with "foo"

Wizards receive extra information about the muds, such as the library
and driver versions, and the administrator of the mud.
