Player Command
==============

$$see :time
USAGE::

	timezone <value>

Sets the player's time difference (relative to GMT).
This lets the mud display your local time as part of the time command.
It's probably easier to look at a clock, but this does allow you to see
at a glance if the mud's clock is wrong.
