Documentation for the width player command in */cmds/player/width.c*.

Player Command
==============

USAGE::

	width
	width <number>
	width auto

 Allows you to see (or set) what the mud will use as your screen width when
 formatting information. Some clients send the width of the terminal window,
 and if yours do that, you can use 'width auto' to set your width automatically.
 It's probably a good idea to set it to the same as your client' setting,
 so they don't get confused when talking to each other.
