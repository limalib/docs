Player Command
==============

See: `ansi <ansi.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	colours
	colours <name> <value>
	colours remove <value>

This command handles customising the colours displayed in the mud -
ie changing them to suit your tastes
Some of types items displayed in the mud are allocated a "colour name",
which is then given a default "colour value"
eg "say" could be given a value "blue", in which case all "says" would
appear in blue
If you wish to have them appear in red, you would use :
colours say red
You can also use "bold" as a colour, with comma if necessary - eg
colour say bold,red
You can clear your personalised setting, and revert to the mud default, with
colours remove say
