Player Command
==============

See: `mode <mode.html>`_ `palette <palette.html>`_ 

USAGE colours
     colours <name> <value>
     colours remove <value>

This command handles customising the colours displayed in the mud -
ie changing them to suit your tastes
Some of types items displayed in the mud are allocated a "colour name",
which is then given a default "colour value"
eg "say" could be given a value "blue", in which case all "says" would
appear in blue. If you wish to have them appear in red, you would use::
    colours say red
You can also use "bold" as a colour, with comma if necessary - eg::
    colour say bold,red
You can clear your personalised setting, and revert to the mud default, with::
    colours remove say
Instead of colour names, check the 'palette' command and use numbers from there,
from 001 to 255.
