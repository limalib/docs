Player Command
==============

See: `color <../ingame/color.html>`_ `colours <colours.html>`_ `mode <mode.html>`_ `frames <frames.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	emoji
	emoji on
	emoji off
	emoji list

 Typing "emoji" will show if your character is set to ascii like graphics
 from the mud (used for small charts etc). These can be hard to use on
 screen readers, so if you are using a screen reader it can be recommended
 to be 'emoji off'.

 Use 'emoji list' for a list of supported emojis.
