Player Command
==============

See: `hp <hp.html>`_ `stats <stats.html>`_ `score <score.html>`_ `spells <spells.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	skills

 Prints out a list of your skills and skill ranks.
 - Skill ranks are shown by roman numerals (the higher the better from 0-15)
 - Training points are shown at the end of the skill bars (in yellow)

 Optional arguments are: combat, magic or misc to only show a subsection
 of the skill tree.

 The more you use your skills, the better you get. So things get better all
 the time! When you have a lot of training points, search for a trainer to
 train you. They both need to have the right skills and at the right skill
 rank to train you.
