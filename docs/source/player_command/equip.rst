Documentation for the equip player command in */cmds/player/equip.c*.

Player Command
==============

See: `skills <skills.html>`_ `hp <hp.html>`_ `stats <stats.html>`_ `score <score.html>`_ `pouch <pouch.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	equip

 Shows your wielded and worn weapons and armors, their durability
 and some primary stats. The command also shows your spell failure chance
 which increases with the more medium and heavy armor you wear, the latter
 having a greater impact.

 Reparing and salvaging
---
 You can repair your gear using the 'repair' verb using components from
'salvage' if you are next to a crafting bench. The components can be
 seen in your 'pouch'.

 You can easily salvage by using 'salvage all' which will salvage all
 your tattered equipment. You can salvage other things by salvaging
 them one by one, i.e. 'salvage mace' to salvage your non-tattered mace.

 Use 'repair all' to repair all your equipment. The command will give you
 an estimate of the cost in materials and coins (if needed) before you
 decide to repair or not. Be careful not to repair things you do not want
 to keep. It does not pay to repair things you want to sell.
