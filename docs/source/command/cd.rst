Command
=======

See: `Command: mkdir </command/mkdir.html>`_ `Command: ls </command/ls.html>`_ `Command: pwd </command/pwd.html>`_ `Command: ed </command/ed.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	 cd [directory|obj]

 Most file commands assume you're talking about your current working
 directory, if you do not specify a full path.  This command sets your
 current directory.  If no argument is given,  your home directory will
 become your current working dir.

 With the 'obj' argument it moves you to the directory that 'obj' is in.
