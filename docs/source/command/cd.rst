Documentation for the cd command in */trans/cmds/cd.c*.

Command
=======

See: `Command: mkdir <mkdir.html>`_ `Command: ls <ls.html>`_ `Command: pwd <pwd.html>`_ `Command: ed <ed.html>`_ 

USAGE:  cd [directory|obj]

Most file commands assume you're talking about your current working
directory, if you do not specify a full path.  This command sets your
current directory.  If no argument is given,  your home directory will
become your current working dir.

With the 'obj' argument it moves you to the directory that 'obj' is in.
