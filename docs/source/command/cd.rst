Command *cd*

Documentation for the cd command in */trans/cmds/cd.c*.

Command
=======

See: `Command: mkdir <mkdir.html>`_ `Command: ls <ls.html>`_ `Command: pwd <pwd.html>`_ `Command: ed <ed.html>`_ `Command: uncd <uncd.html>`_ 

USAGE:  ``cd [directory|obj]``

Most file commands assume you're talking about your current working
directory, if you do not specify a full path.  This command sets your
current directory.  If no argument is given,  your home directory will
become your current working dir.

``cd -`` brings you to your previous working directory (like ``uncd``).

With the 'obj' argument it moves you to the directory that 'obj' is in.
