Command
=======

$$see: bak
USAGE::

	rst <filename>

 Restores a previous backup of a file.

 This command takes one argument, either a path and a file or just a
 file. It will then prompt you, asking which file you'd like to restore
 from.

 Obviously, restorations will fail if no "bak" directory is
 present off the given path, or if the file has not been
 previously backed up.

 Menu item ? will show your selection, again. Menu item
 q will cancel the restoration process.


.. note:: "rst /secure/daemons/user_d.c" -> doesn't work. (line 92)
.. note:: This command currently requires you only to supply a filename, (line 93)
.. note:: and will not work if given a fully-qualified path. (line 94)
