Command
=======

$$see: unsnoop, snoops
USAGE::

	 snoop < name >

This command will allow you to see exactly what appears on the
named characters screen, if the player has snoopable on.
Admins can snoop anybody at any time.

ALL SNOOPS ARE LOGGED.
Spying on a player for no better reason than just to do it will
not be tolerated by the admin of this mud.
Use this command to help find bugs and see what exactly the player
did etc.  but in no way use it to spy on players.
