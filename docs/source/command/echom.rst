Command
=======

See: `Command: echo <command/echo>`_ `Command: echoall <command/echoall>`_ `Command: m_messages <command/m_messages>`_ 

USAGE::

	echo @<target> <message>

Provides a targetted echo facility, which uses the "message" syntax.
If the target cannot be found, it is ignored - ie the message is treated
as a "simple_action" - so presence of $t in the message would cause error.

>You test the echom command on Fred
and Fred and onlookers would see suitably adjusted versions.
