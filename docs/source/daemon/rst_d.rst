Documentation for the rst_d daemon in */daemons/rst_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

 The RST (reStructured Text) daemon handles finding source files which have been modified and
 updating the RST documentation.

Functions
=========



.. c:function:: varargs string compose_message(object forwhom,
                               string msg,
                               object *who,
                               mixed *obs...)

The lowest level message composing function; it is passed the object
for whom the message is wanted, the message string, the array of people
involved, and the objects involved.  It returns the appropriate message.
Usually this routine is used through the higher level interfaces.



.. c:function:: void scan_mudlib()


Recursively searches the mudlib for files which have been changed
since the last time the docs were updated, and recreates the documentation
for those files.



.. c:function:: void complete_rebuild()


Rebuild all the data, regardless of modification time

TODO list
=========

1.  Finish the daemon. And check that it works.

.. note:: regexp() doesn't match any ";", had to replace_string() them (line 296)
