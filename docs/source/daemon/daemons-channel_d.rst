Documentation for the daemons-channel_d daemon in */daemons/channel_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

Daemon for handling channels.

Basic architecture: this daemon records all active channels for
registered listener objects.  Incoming tells/emotes are then passed
to the objects.  In particular, player objects register at login
time and unregister at exit time.

Channel types:
 -      Local: Publically available channel for this MUD
 -     Wizard: Wizard only
 - Restricted: Channels used through other means, like an item in your inventory.
               Cannot be tuned into normally via 'chan' command.
 -      Admin: Only admins can use these. 

Note: (un)registration uses the previous object
