Daemon mission_d
*****************

Documentation for the daemons-mission_d daemon in */daemons/mission_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

This daemon handles player misisons, and centralizes controling them.
Missions are generally repeatable, unlike quests that can only be done
once.
Missions can be multiplayer experiences, unlike quests that are inherently
single player. They typically have a mission giver, that can provide a list
of variants that are available.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: class mission_info *live_missions(string domain)

Fetch all the live missions from the mission givers.
This array will return what is currently available and live.
