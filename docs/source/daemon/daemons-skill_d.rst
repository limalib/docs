Daemon skill_d
***************

Documentation for the daemons-skill_d daemon in */daemons/skill_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

This daemon keeps track of valid skills, registers new skills, and removes unwanted
skills. It also creates percentages for skills, calculates skill ranks for players
and monsters (Wait, skill ranks for monsters? Yes, you can use the ``skills`` command
to see which skills your monsters have.)

A couple of useful commands:

   - Dump current skills to config file: ``@SKILL_D->dump_skills_to_file()``
   - Load skills from config file: ``@SKILL_D->init_skills()``

This might eventually get an admtool interface.
