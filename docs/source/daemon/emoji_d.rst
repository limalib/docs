Module Information
==================

EMOJI_D by Tsath April 2020
(Had to do something while under lockdown)

The EMOJI_D stores emoji names along with an array pair of
    ({  THE UTF char   , Replacement string  })

It also has a supporting function called
 string emoji_replace(string s);

This function replaces the replacements in whatever string it is
given. You can use the emoji_replace to add emoji support to specific
things like channels or say.

The daemon is controlled via the admtool.
