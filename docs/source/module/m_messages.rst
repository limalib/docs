.. c:function:: varargs string compose_message(object forwhom, string msg, object *who, 
  mixed *obs...)

The lowest level message composing function; it is passed the object
for whom the message is wanted, the message string, the array of people

.. c:function:: varargs string *action(object *who, mixed msg, mixed *obs...)

Make the messages for a given group of people involved.  The return
value will have one array per person, as well as one for anyone else.
inform() can be used to send these messages to the right people.

.. c:function:: void inform(object *who, string *msgs, mixed others)

Given an array of participants, and an array of messages, and either an

participant, being careful not to deliver a message twice.
The last arg is either a room, in which that room is told the 'other'
message, or an array of people to recieve the 'other' message.



.. c:function:: varargs void simple_action(mixed msg, mixed *obs...)

Generate and send messages for an action involving the user and possibly
some objects
