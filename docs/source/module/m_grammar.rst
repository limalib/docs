Documentation for the m_grammar module in */std/modules/m_grammar.c*.

Module Information
==================

 The grammar module contains a number of functions for producing high
 quality english output.

Functions
=========



.. c:function:: string pluralize(string str)

Convert a noun to it's plural form.  Oddly enough, it's also quite
good at converting verbs to their singular form, since going from plural to
singular often entails adding an 's'.  Eg, they run, he runs.



.. c:function:: string number_of(int num, string what)

Handles the common operation: "0 bogs", "1 bog", "2 bogs", ...
number_of(num, what)



.. c:function:: string number_word(int num)

number_word(1) == "one", etc.  number_word(10) == "10" and similarly
for numbers greater than 10, which is consistent with most English
style guidelines
