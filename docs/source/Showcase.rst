============
Frame layout
============

LIMA supports fancy frames player commands, and include both horizontal and vertical headers. The frames
can be themed in different colours and styles using the `frames command <../player_command/frames.html>`_, 
either using UTF-8 characters or simple ASCII characters. If your MUD client does not support UTF-8, 
you will automatically receive the ASCII version. The frames will automatically fit the width of your 
screen or whatever you select using the `width <../player_command/width.html>`_ player command. 
Depending on the command, some commands may adopt their internal layout depending on the 
width of your screen.
