  Frequently asked questions should be questions that actually got asked.
  Formulate them as a question and an answer.
  Consider that the answer is best as a reference to another place in the documentation.

Initial woes

Why is IMUD_D complaining and how to fix it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IMUD_D requires a valid email set in ``/include/config.h`` under:

.. code-block:: c

   /* The administrator(s)' email address(es).
    * NOTE: This is required to be changed in order to have a working
    * I3/IMUD_D system. Must be changed for anything to work!
    */
   #define ADMIN_EMAIL "billg@microsoft.com"

Once that has been changed, log in to your MUD, and do 

   |  update \`IMUD_D\`

and it should then load.

Why am I getting "Too long evaluation. Execution aborted."?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is usually caused by your MUD host being a bit on the slow side, and slowing down
the call_out() rate the daemons use can help this. Go to ``/include/config.h``
and change this:

.. code-block:: c

   /* Delay factor for DAEMON call_outs(). 
    * Some daemons may be a bit too greedy for your machine causing:
    * "Too long evaluation. Execution aborted."
    * If you are getting these increase this number to 5, or 10.
    * Otherwise, enjoy your powerful machine, and keep it at 1.
    */
   #define TOO_GREEDY_DAEMONS 1

Change the 1 here to as low a number as will make the issue go away. You can try
5 or 10, and then possibly reduce it a bit once the errors stop nagging you.

Alternatively, upgrade your hosting to a bigger potato. ðŸ¥”

How do I get the didlog working?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first start the MUD, you will get a message like:

    |  No active mudlib version. Set your first version with:
    |  didlog -newversion 0.0.1
    |  didlog -help (for more)

This is the didlog system complaining that you need to set a new version. The didlog
is a system where you and your team of wizards can log your changes and make it easier
to cooperate. First, create a new version:

    |  didlog -newversion 0.0.1
    |  I created the first didlog for version 0.0.1! Woo!

Yes, "I" is a command, try it out, like above!

This will give you a warning ``Sorry, but only full wizards may use the didlog.``. 
But you are an admin? What is going on? Simple, LIMA supports guest wizards, and
full wizards and guest wizards are separated by having a home directory. So, 
go create a directory for yourself.

    |  cd /wiz
    |  mkdir bob

If your name is Bob - use the right name here, obviously. Then try didlog again:

    |  I tests the didlog system.
    |  didlog

Now, you can see your didlog entry in the didlog, and you will not see the warning
when logging in again. Talk to your wizard team on when to create a new version 0.0.2
or even 1.0 at some point. Happy didlogging!

.. tip::

    You can undo a didlog by doing ``@DID_D->someone_didnt()``, if you regret
    or one of your fellow developers made a boo-boo.
