Parties

.. TAGS: RST

Parties can be formed on the MUD to share loot and experience points between
players. The party can be created using the 'party' command, with a password 
to join set. Players aware of this password can join the party should they want to.

The party lead has specific actions:

- Changing the password
- Inviting other players
- Kicking members
- Changing lead
- Signing over lead to another party member.

Each party can have a colour theme, that can be shown in various locations.

Each party tracks how many kills are done, by whom, and the last 10 kills can be 
shown at any time.

To start a party, use the ``party`` command, to join one after receiving an invite
use ``party join``.

As a member of a party, you can see how your party compares to other active
parties, and show you a list of who is in your party and see their contribution.
